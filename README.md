# StickyNotes
Handy webpage for creating sticky notes using HTML5, CSS, Javascript.
Type in your quick to-do lists and grocery list on this webpage. 


Note - This was built in 2014, when WebSQL - window.openDatabase() was not deprecated. This let you save your sticky note information on your browser, so that when you close the window and open it again, you would see all your sticky notes.
Now that the API is deprecated, the notes will be deleted when you close the window.
